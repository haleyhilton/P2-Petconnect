## Description

PetConnect is a marketplace app to connect dog breeders with clients. People can view seller pages and see ratings based on past user experiences. Users can share their current 'family' to assuage breeder concerns over compatibility and competency of ownership. They can also keep the breeder posted on how well the dog is doing in their new home. Breeders can post dogs for sale, which can be searched for through the database, as well as have an opportunity to submit medical records, images etc

As of 2022, the pet industry has grown to over $245 billion a year - meaning one main thing, people are willing to spend serious money when it comes to their pets

As a user, I want an app to find and follow reputable breeders, so that I can purchase a dog with confidence.
